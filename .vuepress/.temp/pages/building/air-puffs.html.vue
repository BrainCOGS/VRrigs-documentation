<p>The air puffs module can be divided in two main parts, the air pressure regulation and valve control and the delivery of the stimuli.</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the screw from the front of the miniature compressed air regulator (placing the inlet down and the regulator screw at the right) and screw in the pressure gauge. Place the straight reducer, 3/8 x 1/8 NPT male at the inlet of the regulator and a push-to-connect tube fitting for 3/8&quot; tube OD x 1/8 NPT male at the oulet of the regulator. Then screw the assembly into the second outlet of the air supply manifold.</li>

<p>Make sure to place this assembly before screwing the air supply manifold to the T-slotted frame.</p>

<ol>
<li>Have made the air puffs control manifold in a machine shop in aluminum. Insert at the right end (placing the small 10-32 holes facing down) a plug with hex drive, 1/8 NPTF, at the bottom a pair of 1/16&quot; tube ID x 10-32 thread male pipe barbed tube fitting, at the left a push-to-connect tube fitting for 3/8&quot; tube OD x 1/8 NPT male, and finally a pair of subminiature solenoid valves for air from Gems sensors and controls (EG2020-06MM-B-G1-204).</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>Place a couple of 10-24 square nuts at the back of the manifold to DIN rail clip adapter, if needed apply some pressure to it for them to enter completely into the hole (you could use a hammer for this), then use a couple of 6-32 x 1&quot; long screws to screw the manifold to the adapter. After that, use a couple of number 6 size, 1/4&quot; long thread-forming screws to attach a 75 mm DIN rail mounting clip to the adapter. Place the entire assembly into the bottom DIN rail, somewhere between the hole for the tubing and the air supply manifold.</li>

<li>Connect the manifold outputs to the tube fitting at the back of the spout holder inside the rig using tygon PVC tubing for food, beverage, and dairy 1/16&quot; ID, 1/8&quot; OD. If you installed a hose and cable carrier, make sure to pass them through it.</li>
