# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The animal position in the ball should prioritize the correct posture for running whithin boundaries of the projection calibration. The projection is calibrated assuming the animal eyes are going to be positioned 0.256 inches behind the center of the ball on the X axis, 1 inch over the top of the center of the ball on the Y axis and centered along the Z axis. A 0.5 inches range error is acceptable.

To this end, a positioning tool was designed taking as reference the 2 pillars that are part of the stage of the mini VR rig. The tool consist on a 3D printed part that hold a glued transparency, lines are made with a marker for the Y position of the animal (1st and 2nd dents of the tool) and the Z line (A and B arrows on the tool). The user can easily use this tool to adjust the animal in the right X and Y position, and the height must be fine tuned to allow the animal to run comfortable.

The tool also has space to add a magnet fixed with epoxy resin on the pillars holes to be steady when placed on top of the pillars.

::: warning
The pillars must be placed in the correct holes of the breadboard as shown in the figure, otherwise the distance from the center of the ball could be wrong.
