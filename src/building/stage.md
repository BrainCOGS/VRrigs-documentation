# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The stage holds a 3D printed cup where the optical flow sensor is placed at the bottom and a hose is connected to deliver a constant air flow to make a styrofoam ball float at the top. The mice is head fixed on top of the ball, allowing it to run, while the optical flow sensor update the virtual world projected on the screen.

The stage has 2 main components, a pair of optical breadboard that set the proper height of the styrofoam ball and hence the proper position of the mice regarding the virtual world; and the 3D printed cup that hold the optical flow sensor and redirects the air flow toward the bottom of the styrofoam ball to make it float.
