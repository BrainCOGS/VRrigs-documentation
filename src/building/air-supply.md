The air supply module consist of a manifold that is connected to the main lab air supply, a air flow control valve that is connected into the manifold and its output goes to a airflowmeter, which provides a constant flow of air trough an adapter placed in the panel of the cabinet to the cup to make the styrofoam ball float. The manifold also provide air to other modules, such as the air puffs, and has the flexibility to add another manifold if other modules require an air supply.
