The air puffs module can be divided in two main parts, the air pressure regulation and valve control and the delivery of the stimuli.

## Pressure regulator assembly

1. Assemble the gauge and the pressure regulator with the proper fittings at input and output.

2. Screw the gauge to the main supply manifold and connect the outlet to the control manifold.

One of the outputs from the main air supply manifold is used for the air puffs, a 3/8" outer diameter tube to 3/8" NPT male push to connect tube fitting is used to connect a 3/8" outer diameter tube from the air supply manifold to a compressed air regulator. A precision compressed air regulator with 1/8" NPT female inputs and 1-30 PSI range is used, a pair of 3/8" tube outer diameter to 3/8" NPT push to connect fittings are attached to both input and output of the regulator, a 1-30 pressure gauge is also connected to the regulator to easily adjust the air puff pressure as needed.

## Control manifold assembly

1. Connect everything that needs to be connected to the control manifold.

2. Screw the control manifold to the adapter to the DIN rail mounting clip and mount into the DIN rail.

3. Connect the valves output to the spout mount.

4. Connect the valves to the proper outputs of the solenoid valve driver in the control module.


The control manifold has screwed to one side a 3/8" tube outer diameter to 1/8" NPT push to connect fitting and on the other side a 1/8" NPT plug. Screwed at the bottom of the manifold are a pair of 1/16" tube internal diameter to 10-32 thread male low pressure tube fitting and at the top a pair of E2012 manifold mount 10-32 threaded stud subminiature solenoid valves from Gems sensors and controls. The controlled air pressure output from the regulator is then attached with a 3/8" outer diameter tube to the control manifold and the output is connected to the delivery part mounted on the reward spout with a 1/16" inner diameter and 1/8" outer diameter tygon tube.

The delivery of the air puffs is done with a Delrin part that is designed to be attached to the reward delivery module, it has 2 holes made at an angle of 45 degrees to point the air flow toward the whiskers of the mice and avoid the eyes. This part consist on 2 pieces that are tightened around the reward spout with 0-80 1/4" long screws. At the back, two 1/6" tube internal diameter to 10-32 thread male barbed tube fitting are screwed to attach the tygon tube coming from the control manifold output.
