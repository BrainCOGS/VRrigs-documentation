The cabinet is the box made out of T-slotted frames and panels in which all the components of the training rig are going to be held, and works as an sound insulated space in which the mice wild be performing the tasks. All the control and other modules components are going to be placed on one of the sides of the cabinet, and the projector will be placed at the back of it.

## Cabinet assembly

We use 1.5" x 1.5" T-slotted profile to build the frame of the cabinet and 1/4" black harcell ABS (smooth side up) to build the panels. We contact the Knotts Company and ask for a kit of PRN024, which contains all the pieces needed to build the cabinet, but the pieces described in the drawing can be ordered from other supplier or suppliers. Assemble the cabinet following the steps below.

1. We start building the cabinet from the bottom up. Slide a pair of bottom plate holders (8020 - 2425) into the 24.5 inches long profile. Make sure the top part of the holder is at the same height as the top part of the profile, as shown in the picture below. Repeat the process for another 24.5" long profile.

2. Insert a standard end fastener to both ends of the 24.5" long profile with the bottom plate holders and to a pair of 22.5" long profiles. First insert the fastener into one of the slots and loosely screw it, repeat the process with the other end making sure the direction of the fastener is the same. Make this for both ends of the 4 profiles.

3. Arrange the profiles in a square, making sure that the profiles with the plate holders are facing each other to the left and right, and in the correct position (top part of the holder must be at the same height as the top part of the profile); and the 22.5" long profiles are fecing each other at the back and front. Use the 22.05" long profile with holes at 1.5" from the ends to join the front part, and use the 22.05" long profile with holes at 1.5" from both ends and a hole at 11.675" from the top down to join the back part of the rig. Introduce the profiles from the top down and tight screw trough the holes.

4. Place the aluminum bottom plate on top of the frames, slide the bottom plate holders so that they match the plate holes. If the holes don't match in the lateral position, you can unscrew the holders just enough for them to reach the holes. Use 5/16-18 x 0.625" long screws to tight screw the bottom plate to the holders.

::: tip
 If working on an elevated table, you could push into the air the structure just enough to have visibility on the bottom and match the holders to the holes, then turn around the structure and repeat the process.
