The cabinet is the box made out of T-slotted frames and panels in which all the components of the training rig are going to be held, and works as an sound insulated space in which the mice wild be performing the tasks. All the control and other modules components are going to be placed on one of the sides of the cabinet, and the projector will be placed at the back of it.
