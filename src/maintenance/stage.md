The stage maintenance consist mainly on the replacement of the ball, and the optical flow sensor calibration. Troubleshooting should be done from cleaning the 3D cup and window first, making sure the ball is in proper conditions, and then the optical flow sensor replacement if necessary, then the arduino. If the arduino is the problem, refer to the troubleshooting guide in the control portion of the documentation.
