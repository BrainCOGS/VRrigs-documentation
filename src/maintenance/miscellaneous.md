## 3D Printing

### Print

1. Export 3D print design from software as STL file and make sure to select the units.
2. Use PreForm to open the STL file, use the orientation tool and generate the support structures as needed.
3. Ensure that the build platform is clean and placed correctly. Properly insert the resin tank and resin cartridge - making sure the tap is open.
4. Upload the print.
5. Printer will indicate if any component is missin, also will prompt if it needs leveling. Follow the instructions accordingly.
6. Once finished, remove the build platform and close the cover to avoid light exposure to uncured resin in the tank.

### Wash

1. Put some gloves on. Remove the print from the platform using a scraper -or just remove the quick release platform by pushing inwards both arms.
2. Rinse the print with IPA using a squeeze bottle. You can use compressed air to remove resin from concealed areas.
3. Open the Form Wash and place the print inside.
4. Select [resin-appropiate wash cycle](https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Form-Wash-Time-Settings?language=en_US) and start.
5. Rinse additional uncured resin using the squeeze bottle and let it dry for at least 30 minutes.

### Cure

1. Once the print is completely dry, place it inside the Form Cure and select the [appropiate curing settings](https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Form-Cure-Time-and-Temperature-Settings?language=en_US), then press start.
2. Once finished, allow the print to cool down to ambient temperature. This will avoid warping.
3. Remove the print and remove the supports.
4. Use sandpaper to remove any remaining suport marks.
