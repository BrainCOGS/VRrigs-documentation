The reward maintenance consist mainly on the monthly cleaning of the reward valves and the calibration. (Monthly for condensed milk use, 2 or 3 months for sucrose and for water it should be way longer, altough we don't know since we don't use plain water).

## Valve calibration

## Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting is mostly done from top down. Check first for clogging or anything else from srynge to valve, then from valve in to valve out, then from valve out to spout, and clean or replace accordingly.
