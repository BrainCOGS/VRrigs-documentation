This guide walks the researcher through every step, along with tips and tricks, for training in the ViRMEn/Datajoint environment.

## New task Creation

### Prerequisites

+ Read the ViRMEn Manual. Access it from the ViRMEn repository (log in to GitHub first): <a href="https://github.com/BrainCOGS/ViRMEn/blob/master/ViRMEn%20manual.pdf">ViRMEn Manual Link</a>
+ Each task is made up of a group of files (2 `.mat` files and 4 `.m` functions) that make everything work. All of them are described below.

### Experiment code file
+ Located in the **ViRMEn\experiments** directory.
+ Controls stimulus presentation and trial/block progression. This code runs every frame; its general structure is a state machine that follows the trial schema.
+ For a detailed guide on how to modify it, see the ViRMEn Manual.
+ Original file: ```C:\Experiments\ViRMEn\experiments\poisson_blocks.m```
+ Most common use:
 1. Copy the existing experiment code file from the most similar task.
 2. Rename the file to a descriptive name (e.g. **"TaskName"_ExperimentCode.mat**).
 3. Change the experiment code logic.
 4. See  <a href="https://braincogs.github.io/software/virmen_guide.html#tips-and-tricks-experiment-code"> Tips and Tricks Experiment Code </a> below for detailed tips.

### World file
+ Located in the **ViRMEn\experiments** directory.
+ Defines the structure and settings of the ViRMEn world(s).
+ For a detailed guide on how to modify it, see the ViRMEn Manual.
+ Original file: ```C:\Experiments\ViRMEn\experiments\poisson_blocks.mat```
+ Most common use:
 1. Copy the existing world file from the most similar task.
 2. Rename the file to a descriptive name (e.g. **"TaskName"_World.mat**).
 3. Run ```virmen``` in MATLAB and open the world (Experiment -> Open).
 4. If no object is going to change, just set the **Experiment code** dropdown (bottom-left corner) to match your experiment code filename.

### Protocol file
+ Located in the **ViRMEn\experiments\protocols** directory.
+ Declares the number of levels, maze settings, and the criteria that decide when to advance a subject to the next level.
+ Original file: ```C:\Experiments\ViRMEn\experiments\protocols\PoissonBlocksCondensed3m.m```

### Stimuli bank file

+ Located in the **ViRMEn\experiments\protocols** directory.
+ Contains the stimulus sets that are drawn from during a session. It holds trial data: tower positions and the number of towers for each maze level, depending on the protocol variables.
+ Original file: ```C:\Experiments\ViRMEn\experiments\protocols\stimulus_trains_PoissonBlocksCondensed3m.mat```
+ Most common use:
 1. Create the protocol and world files.
 2. Run ```generatePoissonStimuli(('world_file'), @('protocol_file'))```, substituting **world_file** and **protocol_file** with the corresponding names.

### RigParameters file

+ Located in the **ViRMEn\extras** directory.
+ Defines the parameters that control and adjust the hardware, display, and motion in a task.
+ Only file: ```C:\Experiments\extras\RigParameters.m```

##### If working on a rig computer:
+ This file has most likely already been set up by the Lab Manager. Do nothing.

##### If working on a personal computer:
+ The most common use for this file on a personal computer is to run ViRMEn simulations without interacting with the hardware. To do this, set:
+ ```simulationMode: = true```
+ ```hasDAQ: = false```
+ This lets you run simulations on any Windows computer and use the keyboard to simulate mouse movement.

## New Training GUI

- The following sections describe the training workflow from start to finish: from selecting which experiment will run to reviewing session performance right after it finishes.
- First steps is defining a training profile & scheduling a subject on a specific rig on the BRAINCoGS Web GUI: https://braincogs-webgui.pni.princeton.edu/. These steps should be done at least the day before the session occurs.
- Next steps are done in the rig computers on the same day of the experiment session.

### Define Training Profile (WebGUI)

### Rig Tester

- The Rig Tester GUI lets you check all of a rig's inputs and outputs (IOs) before training starts. The IOs are predefined via the Input Output Profile and Rig Status tables. See the <a href="https://braincogs.github.io/software/virmen_developer.html#testvrrig-2-rig-tester"> ViRMEn developer Rig Tester section </a> for more information.
- From here on, all steps in the following sections are performed on the rig machine.
- MATLAB should already be open and the Rig Tester GUI should be visible. If not, type ```TrainingToday``` to start the training process.

 <figure>

 </figure>


+ Below is a description of every part of the Rig Tester GUI. Note that some buttons may not be shown (and some extra buttons may appear) compared to the example image.
 1. **Start all tests Button:** Automatically runs all "Automatic Tests", one by one, until they are done.
 2. **Start individual test Button:** For "Output Tests" such as valves and air puffs. This button briefly activates the output so you can manually verify it is working properly.
 3. **Mark Passed/Failed Buttons:** For "Input & Output Tests", the technician pushes this button to mark a test as passed or failed.
 4. **Report Checkboxes:** If a test fails, the technician can report it by checking the report checkbox.
 5. **Calibration Panel:**
    - **Left Valve/Right Valve/Valve Button:** Runs calibration: 25 drops are delivered in the corresponding lick spout. The technician can check whether the volume delivered matches the desired value (4 ul per drop).
    - **Up and Down Arrow Buttons:** Adjust valve timing to reach the desired calibration.
    - **Set calibration time Button:** Saves the adjusted valve times in the RigParameters file.
    - **Both valves Button:** Calibrates both valves simultaneously.
 6. **Ready Button:** If all tests pass, proceed to the Training Flow GUI screen.
 7. **Report & Comment Button:** If at least one IO test does not pass and the report checkboxes are marked, a report screen appears where you can add comments for the Lab Manager (see below). A Slack message is sent to the **#rig_issues_and_troubleshooting** channel when a report is sent.

- If a rig parameter is missing from the RigParameters.m file for the configured IOs, a dialog like the one below appears. Add the parameters to the RigParameters.m file and see the <a href="https://braincogs.github.io/software/virmen_developer.html#testvrrig-2-rig-tester"> ViRMEn developer Rig Tester section </a> for more information.

### Training Flow GUI

- Once the Rig Tester GUI passes, the Training Flow GUI appears.
- This GUI is the interface to:
    - Start subject training

## Old Training GUI

### Program wrapper file

+ Located in the **ViRMEn\experiments\programs** directory.
+ Sets up a cohort of animals on the training GUI.
+ Original file: ```C:\Experiments\ViRMEn\experiments\programs\trainPoissonBlocks_lp_cohort1.m```
+ Most common use:
 1. Copy the existing program wrapper file from the most similar task.
 2. Rename the file to a descriptive name (e.g. **train"TaskName"_cohort(n).m**).
 3. In the call to the **runCohortExperiment** function, rename the first 3 parameters:
   + **dataPath:** should be ```C:\Data\(NETID)\(String to represent protocol, task or cohort)```
   + **experName:** should be the experiment code name (without .m).
   + **cohortName:** should be a string that identifies the cohort.
  * **experName** and **cohortName** are appended to behavior files.

 2. In MATLAB, enter the following (replace the code in brackets with the corresponding info for the subject):
  ```matlab
  new_record = struct
  new_record.subject_fullname = ['efonseca_ef481_actpg004']; # Subject fullname 
  new_record.ml_position = [17.5]   # ml position in mm (motor axis#1 position in GUI)
  new_record.ap_position = [10]     # ap position in mm (motor axis#2 position in GUI)
  new_record.dv_position = [15.3]    # dv position in mm (motor axis#3 position in GUI)

Elements that are not described are not used.
 1. **Subject selection:** Dropdown list of all subjects in BRAINCoGS available for training.
 2. **Reward Factor:** Multiplier applied to the reward for each of the warm-up and main mazes. The reward is normally 4 ul for each correct trial on the Towers Task (e.g. if ```RewardFactor = 1.25 -> Reward = 4*1.25 = 5 ul```).
 3. **Motion blur range:** Parameter that sets up the cue elongation effect opposite to the subject's direction of motion in virtual reality. A 2x1 vector where the first element is the distance (in cm) from the subject to the tower cue at which elongation starts, and the second element is the distance (in cm) at which the elongation effect stops. Leave empty for no motion blur effect. Common values: ```[28 5], []```.
 4. **Restart or append session:** Action to perform when a session is restarted.
 + If **APPEND SESSION** is selected, each time the session is restarted the "new" session is counted as new blocks of the same session.
 + If **START NEW SESSION** is selected, each time the session is restarted a new session is created (recommended when physiology recordings are performed, to make the syncing process easier).
 5. **Protocol code file selector:** Dropdown to select the protocol code file; see the <a href="https://braincogs.github.io/software/virmen_guide.html#new-task-creation">New task creation section for detailed information</a>.

## Tips and Tricks Experiment Code

### Add variables to behavior file

+ It is often necessary to store additional variables in the behavior file for further analysis.

#### Add variables on the trial level
 1. Go to the ```setupTrials``` function in the experiment code.
 2. Find a line like this: ```cfg.trialData         = { 'trialProb', 'trialType', 'choice', 'trialID' ... ```
 3. Add the variable name at the end of the **cfg.trialData** cell array.
+ Remember to define that variable as vr.(variableName) in ```initializationCodeFun()``` or ```runtimeCodeFun()``` before the 1st trial is over.

#### Add variables on the block level
 1. Go to the ```setupTrials``` function in the experiment code.
 2. Find a line like this: ```cfg.blockData         = { 'mazeID', 'mainMazeID', 'motionBlurRange', 'iterStr', 'shapingProtocol' ... ```
 3. Add the variable name at the end of the **cfg.blockData** cell array.
+ Remember to define that variable as vr.(variableName) in ```initializationCodeFun()``` or ```runtimeCodeFun()``` before the 1st trial is over.

### Set code ready for simulation

+ It is useful to have the experiment code ready for simulations, so you can test all changes without interacting with the rig hardware.
+ Setting the code up for simulation also enables making trial-by-trial videos with the <a href="https://github.com/BrainCOGS/ReproduceTrialTowers">ReproduceTrialTowers repository</a>.
 1. Find all lines in the experiment code that interact with hardware (every line starting with **nidaq..** and the **updateDAQSyncSignals** function — the hardware code lines).
 2. Add the line ```if RigParameters.hasDAQ``` before the hardware code lines and close the if after them.

### Solve common errors during training

#### Arduino Serial communication error

+ Errors like these:
 ```matlab
 Open failed: Port: COM7 is not available. Available ports: COM1.
 Use INSTRFIND to determine if other instrument objects are connected to the requested device.
 ```
 ```matlab
 Serial communications have not been properly initiated.
 ```
 ```matlab
 Device Error: Unanticipated host error
 ```
+ These are the most common errors during training. Check whether the Arduino COM port is found in Device Manager, and restart MATLAB and/or the system to solve this.

#### virmen variable not properly set

 ```matlab
 Reference to non-existent field (variable_name)...
 ```
 ```matlab
 Unrecognized field name (variable_name).
 ```
+ This error is solved by initializing the variable in ```initializationCodeFun()``` (e.g. ```vr.(variable_name) = 0```).

#### Nidaq channel is busy or not found

```matlab
 [nidaqPulseRightReward:commit]  Requested operation could not be performed, because the specified digital lines are either reserved or the device is not present in NI-DAQmx.
 It is possible that these lines are reserved by another task or the device is being reset. If you are using these lines with another task, wait for the task to complete.  If you want to force the other task to relinquish the device, reset the device. If you are resetting the device, wait for the reset to finish.
 Device:  Dev1

 Task Name: RightReward

 Status Code: -200587
```
+ Review the **RigParameters.m** file and check that there is no overlap between the input/output channel variables (rewardChannel, laserChannel, rightPuffChannel, leftPuffChannel, rightRewardChannel, leftRewardChannel, newIterationChannel, newTrialChannel, etc.).
